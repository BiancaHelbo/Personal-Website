			A hobby of mine is video games. I've played games since I was little where it started as childrens games.
			Then I moved on to RPGs, Role Playing Games, such as The Elder Scrolls series, and I ended up at MMORPGs, 
			Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games, with World of Warcraft as the one I'm still playing on my 8th year.<br>
			I like playing WoW because of the community and the experience of playing with other people from all over Europe.
			The guild I'm in, I've been in for 5 years and I've met so many wonderful people.
			Three nights a week we meet up to raid. The thrill of getting a boss down that you've worked on for several weeks,
			is just so nice.<br>
			Especially when it's with your guildies.

			I enjoy exploring other video games aswell. I love immersing myself in the stories that other people have come up with,
			and feeling when a developer has put a lot of effort into a video game.
