		<p class="aboutme">
			I'm a 21 year old Danish girl from a suburbian town in Denmark. I grew up in a nice town close to the beach, with my mom, my dad and my younger brother. <br>
			We used to travel a lot and we've been to many different locations; Aruba, The Dominican Republic, France, Italy, and it was always 
			great to experience other cultures and seeing so many different things. <br>
			One of my favorite locations were Aruba where we went snorkeling and experienced fishes of so many different colours and shapes.<br>
			Three years ago we decided to get a dog, a Golden Retriever that we named Marley. We stopped traveling, but enjoyed the time with our lovely dog.

		<p class="aboutme">
			Since I was very young, I’ve had a great passion for computer games and computers in general and when I got older, I developed yet another passion for the internet and making small webpages for fun. The internet is a big part of my daily life and I love looking at beautifully, cleverly created websites. <br>
			This passion is what drives me towards becoming a multimedia designer who designs useful and beautiful webpages etc. for other people to look at and enjoy during their daily lives.

			Another big part of my life is music. I started playing the cello when I was about 7 years old, but stopped when I didn't feel like it was the right intrument for me. <br>
			I then started singing in a church choir, where I ended up staying for 8 years. <br>
			In the meantime I started playing the piano, which I still do occasionally, but I mostly taught myself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I live in Copenhagen with my boyfriend and my cat. I study at KEA and I look forward to becoming a great Multimedia Designer in the future.
