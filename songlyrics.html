		<h5>By Jonathan Coulton, used in video game "Portal"</h5>
			<p class="songlyrics">
			This was a triumph. <br>
			I'm making a note here: Huge success. <br>
			It's hard to overstate my satisfaction. <br>
			Aperture Science <br>
			We do what we must <br>
			because we can. <br>
			For the good of all of us. <br>
			Except the ones who are dead. <br>
			<p class="songlyrics">
			But there's no sense crying over every mistake. <br>
			You just keep on trying till you run out of cake. <br>
			And the Science gets done. <br>
			And you make a neat gun. <br>
			For the people who are still alive. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="songlyrics">
			I'm not even angry. <br>
			I'm being so sincere right now. <br>
			Even though you broke my heart <br>
			and killed me. <br>
			And tore me to pieces. <br>
			And threw every piece into a fire. <br>
			As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you! <br>
			</p>
			<p class="songlyrics">
			Now these points of data make a beautiful line. <br>
			And we're out of beta. <br>
			We're releasing on time. <br>
			So I'm GLaD. I got burned. <br>
			Think of all the things we learned <br>
			for the people who are still alive. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="songlyrics">
			Go ahead and leave me. <br>
			I think I prefer to stay inside. <br>
			Maybe you'll find someone else to help you. <br>
			Maybe Black Mesa. <br>
			That was a joke. <br>
			Haha. Fat chance. <br>
			Anyway, this cake is great. <br>
			It's so delicious and moist. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="songlyrics">
			Look at me still talking <br>
			when there's Science to do. <br>
			When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you. <br>
			I've experiments to run. <br>
			There is research to be done. <br>
			On the people who are still alive. <br>
			</p>
			<p class="songlyrics">
			And believe me I am still alive. <br>
			I'm doing Science and I'm still alive. <br>
			I feel fantastic and I'm still alive. <br>
			While you're dying I'll be still alive. <br>
			And when you're dead I will be still alive. <br>
			Still alive. <br>
			Still alive. <br>
